# Function to perform text summarization
# The function summarize_text() takes the input text and the OpenAI API key as input. The Large Language Model is initialized with OpenAI. The input text is split into smaller segments. This is done to make sure that the text is not too long for the summarization chain. If the text segments are not valid, an error message is shown. The text segments are converted into Document objects. This is done to make sure that the text is in the right format for the summarization chain. If the document list is not valid, an error message is shown. The text summarization chain is set up. The summarization chain is run and the result is returned.

# Function to translate text
# The function translate_text() takes the input text, the source language and the target language as input. Before the user could only input the target language, but then it would only translate if the input was English, now the user can also type in another language. The language code for the languages is found. The Translator is initialized with the target language code. The max_length is set to 500, because the Translator can only translate text with a maximum length of 500 characters. The input text is split into smaller segments. This is done to make sure that the text is not too long for the translation. The text segments are translated and combined. The translated text is returned.
